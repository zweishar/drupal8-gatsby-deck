import { ThemeName } from './theme'
export { theme } from './theme'

# Hello <ThemeName />!

This deck has a custom Provider component
that lets you switch between all the different themes.

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
```
