# Drupal 8 & Gatsby JS
## What, Why, How

Gatsby JS is a static site generator that pairs particularly well with Drupal 8.

This presentation reviews the shared landscape between Gatsby + Drupal in order to better understand:

- What Gatsby is and the benefits that it provides
- Where it does (and doesn't) make sense to employ a blended architecture between Gatsby & Drupal
- How an integration between Gatsby & Drupal 8 can be achieved, from the perspective of an example marketing site
- This talk is designed to be accessible to a beginner / intermediate audience. However, it does assume some familiarity with Drupal.
